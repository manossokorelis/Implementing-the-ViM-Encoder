# Implementing-the-Vision-Transformer-Encoder
The project involves implementing the Vision Transformer (ViT) model using PyTorch for image classification. The primary goal is to demonstrate how the ViT encoder works by breaking images into patches, embedding them into higher-dimensional space, and applying multi-head attention and feed-forward networks to extract features. The model is trained on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset to classify images of various pets based on their category. The dataset is preprocessed with transformations like resizing and converting images to tensor format. The Vision Transformer architecture uses a stack of transformer blocks, along with a custom patch embedding layer, to extract meaningful representations from image patches and predict the class labels.

Key Achievements:
- Implemented a custom Vision Transformer (ViT) model using PyTorch.
- Utilized the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset for training and evaluation, with proper data preprocessing and transformation pipelines.
- Applied multi-head attention and feed-forward networks in a transformer architecture for feature extraction.
- Implemented a patch embedding mechanism to convert images into sequences of patch embeddings.
- Incorporated a classification token (CLS token) to aggregate features from all patches for the final image classification.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and trained the ViT model for image classification.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy and low loss on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of the ViT model for image classification tasks.
- Fine-tuned model parameters using the AdamW optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss to enhance model performance.
